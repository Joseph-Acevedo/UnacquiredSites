# Unacquired Sites

Four-month project to create a pipeline that allows to detect Site Name, Location, Age Span and Site Descriptions from papers in the Neotoma Data Base.
Use NLP processed text and a Data Science approach and detect whether the paper is suitable for Neotoma Data Base.

### Workflow Overview

This project uses the Neotoma GeoDeepDive output files; the sentences_nlp352 (sentences file that contains NLP parsed sentences) and the bibjson (JSON file that contains bibliographic information) as input.

This files should then train a model that will then
- Using additional features, improve the Site Name, Location, Age Span and Site Descriptions.
- Predict whether the paper is suitable for the Neotoma Data Base.


### System Requirements

This project is developed using Python.  
It runs on a MacOS system.
Continuous integration uses TravisCI.

### Data Requirements

The project pulls data from GDD output files.

### Key Outputs

This project will generate a dataset that provides Site Name, Location, Age Span and Site Descriptions from papers in the Neotoma Data Base.

## Metrics
